              In pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, advertisers pay a fee each
              time their ad is clicked by a user. PPC campaigns can target
              specific keywords, demographics, and locations, making it a
              precise way to reach potential customers. PPC is known for its
              ability to drive targeted traffic to websites quickly and can be
              particularly effective when managed well, generating leads, sales,
              and brand exposure.

              Social media marketing for the industry – defining brands. Social
              media for business is more than just sharing pictures of your team
              lunch on Instagram. It can help you build a recognizable brand,
              engage with potential customers, and drive new business. People
              spend an average of 116 minutes a day on social media, so it&apos;s
              important to have a presence where your target audience is
              spending their time. Social media is a great way to connect with
              your customers and grow your business. We offer social media
              services for businesses of all sizes. Our focus is always on ROI,
              or return on investment. Getting started can be tough, but YSY can
              help you every step of the way - from strategy and creative to
              paid media, community management, and campaigns. Let us take over
              and get your social media working for you!
